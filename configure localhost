With XAMPP (Windows)
Locate your hosts file. In Windows XP, this file is located in C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc. Different versions of Windows may store the file in a different directory. And depending on your Windows setup, you might need to be logged in as an administrator to modify the hosts file.
Open the file with a plain text editor (like Notepad++ or Sublime Text). In the hosts file, you should see something similar:
127.0.0.1     localhost
Right below the line 127.0.0.1 localhost, enter your domain name information. Example:

127.0.0.1    mysite.local
127.0.0.1    www.mysite.local
Put all your website files in a folder “mysite” (for example) and put it in C:\xampp\htdocs\ like this C:\xampp\htdocs\mysite.
Go to C:\xampp\apache\conf\
Open httpd.conf file using a plain text editor (like Notepad++ or Sublime Text) and if you have a “#” before Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf, remove it by changing:
# Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
to:

Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
i.e. uncomment the line so that it can includes the virtual hosts file.

Go to C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\ and open httpd-vhosts.conf file using a plain text editor (like Notepad++ or Sublime Text) and add the following code:
<VirtualHost *:80>
	DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/mysite"
	ServerName mysite.local
	ServerAlias www.mysite.local
	<Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs/mysite">
		AllowOverride All
		Require all granted
	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>
If not already open, open XAMPP control panel and start Apache.
Go to the URL: http://mysite.local/
You are done.







With WAMP (Windows)
Same steps as that of XAMPP just change the paths according to WAMP which corresponds to path in XAMPP.

Locate your hosts file. In Windows XP, this file is located in C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc. Different versions of Windows may store the file in a different directory. And depending on your Windows setup, you might need to be logged in as an administrator to modify the hosts file.
Open the file with a plain text editor (like Notepad++ or Sublime Text). In the hosts file, you should see something similar:
127.0.0.1     localhost
Right below the line 127.0.0.1 localhost, enter your domain name information. Example:

127.0.0.1    mysite.local
127.0.0.1    www.mysite.local
Put all your website files in a folder “mysite” (for example) and put it inC:\wamp\www\ like this C:\wamp\www\mysite.
Go to C:\wamp\bin\apache\apacheX.X.XX\conf\
Open httpd.conf file using a plain text editor (like Notepad++ or Sublime Text) and if you have a “#” before Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf, remove it by changing:
# Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
to:

Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
i.e. uncomment the line so that it can includes the virtual hosts file.

Go to C:\wamp\bin\apache\apacheX.X.XX\conf\extra\ and open httpd-vhosts.conf file using a plain text editor (like Notepad++ or Sublime Text) and add the following code:
<VirtualHost *:80>
	DocumentRoot "C:/wamp/www/mysite"
	ServerName mysite.local
	ServerAlias www.mysite.local
	<Directory "C:/wamp/www/mysite">
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>
Restart your server.
Go to the URL: http://mysite.local/
You are done.
